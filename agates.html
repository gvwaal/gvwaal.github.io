            The Lake Superior agate is a semiprecious gemstone characterized by red, orange, yellow, white or translucent bands of chalcedony with variable amounts of coarse-grained quartz crystals. Around 1.1 billion years ago, flood basalts associated with the Midcontinent Rift quickly erupted forming vesicles in the lava. As time passed, siliceous fluids percolated through the rock, filling the vesicles with the concentric bands of chalcedony. Over time, the weathering-resistant agates were released from their host rock and distributed throughout the Lake Superior basin. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021190641/https://www.carleton.edu/departments/geol/resources/comps/compspdffiles/2005/beaster2005.pdf">Beaster (2005)</a> provides a good summary of these stones.

            Minnesota's North Shore (NS) is a popular destination for those in search of agates. Having lived in Duluth, MN for around five years, a frequent question from visiting friends and family is "Where are the best places to look for agates?" This project identifies the best locations for agate picking on the North Shore from a quantitative perspective, using ArcMap 10.4, its Spatial Analyst extension, and Python to work with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics">raster data</a>. <!-- please make this better -->

            <ol>
                <li>Agates will be more common in areas with agate-bearing bedrock.</li><!--improve this too-->
                <li>Agate deposition will occur on mid- to low-angle slopes, such as 40° and below. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180213175502/https://www.earth-surf-dynam.net/2/469/2014/esurf-2-469-2014.pdf">Stark et. al (2014)</a> indicates the angle of repose for mixed sediment that's mostly gravel will likely be between 30 and 40°</li> <!-- improve this, especially the second sentence. flow can be improved-->
                <li>The most agates will be located closest to the lake (within 10m), since only the strongest (and therefore least common) wave action will be able to move agates inland.</li>
                <li>The locations with the most agates will be those least visited by humans, and therefore most distant from roads.</li>
                <li>The user will acquire permission from relevant land owners before visiting or collecting from areas highlighted here.</li>

            <p>
                Of the 17 quadrangles gathered for use in this project, 11 were in legacy GIS formats (seven of which
                required <a href="http://support.esri.com/en/technical-article/000004705">conversion</a> from ArcInfo Interchange
                to a coverage), three had modern GIS formats, and three were scanned PDFs <code title="PDFToTIFF_conversion (&quot;map_pdf&quot;, &quot;map_tif&quot;, , , , , 650, &quot;RGB_TRUE_COLOR&quot;, &quot;NONE&quot;, )">converted</code> to .tif for use in ArcMap. All files were
                imported into a geodatabase to ensure compatability (coverages do not work with Polygon to Raster).
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The bedrock feature classes were converted to rasters using <code title="PolygonToRaster_conversion (&quot;bedrock_fc&quot;, &quot;<geologic unit code on map>&quot;, &quot;bedrock_rast&quot;, , , 1)">Polygon to Raster</code>. The map PDFs were searched for words that would indicate suitability for being an agate host (agate, chalcedony, vug, amygdule, vesicle, basalt, aphyric, aphanitic) and a field was to the rasters added as a means of weighting. The formations containing "agate" were weighted most highly (9), those containing "basalt" and other semi-relevant words (amygdule, vesicle, vug, aphyric) rated middling (5), and the rest weighted lowest (1).
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the map .tif, the green band was isolated, symbolized with a greyscale (stretched, Minimum-Maximum) color scheme, and exported. The exported band was classified into two classes split at an <em>n</em> value (110) in an attempt to symbolize only the geologic contacts. The raster was exported again and the new raster clipped to the extent of an arbitrary polygon to reduce the time spent cleaning up. This was cleaned up using the Raster Painting toolbar and original RGB .tif as a reference, then converted to polylines using ArcMap's ArcScan toolbar. The lines were <code title="arcpy.FeatureToPolygon_management(in_features=&quot;M066_l&quot;, out_feature_class=&quot;C:/gistest/wr_components.gdb/polygons/M066_p&quot;, cluster_tolerance=&quot;&quot;, attributes=&quot;ATTRIBUTES&quot;, label_features=&quot;&quot;)">converted</code> to polygons and unit codes assigned to each polyon. Agate weights were stored in separate .csv files and joined to the polygons, then converted back into a raster for use in the weighted overlay.

                A <a href="https://github.com/gvwaal/misc-scripts/blob/master/dem_fetch.py">Python script</a> was created
                to quickly download around 180 1-meter DEM tiles needed to cover the NS. The tiles were then merged together using <a href="https://github.com/gvwaal/misc-scripts/blob/master/mosaic.py">a different script</a>
                to save time. A slope raster was created from this data using the <code title="Slope(&quot;dem_1m_mn&quot;, &quot;DEGREE&quot;,)">Slope</code> tool and the result was converted from a floating point raster to an integer raster using the <code title="RasterCalculator (Int(&quot;slope_rast&quot; + 0.5,&quot;slope_rast&quot;,), &quot;slope_rast_int&quot;)">Raster Calculator</code> tool.

                the Weighted Overlay tool, but doing so is potentially time-consuming).<!--While the Minnesota Department of
                Natural Resources (MnDNR)'s <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/maps/mntopo/index.html">MnTOPO application</a>
                allows the user to download elevation data clipped from a user-created polygon, I found that drawing a single
                non-overlapping polygon at sufficient scale covering the entire NS was too time consuming.-->

The portion of the reservation on Lake Superior was traced using the previously-created shoreline feature class and the portion of the reservation within Cook County was traced using the georeferenced map as a reference.

            Prior to using the Weighted Overlay tool, all layers were clipped to retain only the portions within 20m of shore. The computer used during this project is not particularly beefy and has troubles with processing large or complex amounts of data. To compensate, measures were taken to ease processing, such as retaining only the relevant parts of data, reducing bit depth of the rasters, and splitting the processing extents into smaller areas <!--remove if not true-->.
