        <p>
            A <a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/misc/AbtDerechos/derechofaq.htm">derecho</a> blasted through my friend's family cabin property on <a href="https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-weather/national-weather-service-confirms-2-derechos-ripped-through-minnesota-wisconsin">July 19, 2019</a>. Several months ago, a majority of the property was clear-cut in order to remove the downed trees. Naturally, there's some debate about what to do with the significant increase in unforested land, but one of the planned uses was an orchard. My friend was aware of my mapping/geology background and asked me to plot some figures during the design process.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
            During that process I was inspired to conduct a site suitability analysis to see if there were other areas of the property that might be optimally suited for an orchard. As currently designed, the orchard was to be situated adjacent a garden developed by one of the former property owners.

            A site suitability analysis consolidates different datasets with the intent of identifying an ideal location for a use, in this case, an orchard. For this analysis we'll rely on the Weighted Overlay tool provided with Esri's ArcMap software. Using Weighted Overlay looks something like this:
            <ol>
                <li>Identify a goal (find alternate locations that are best suited for an orchard)</li>
                <li>Identify attributes that would assist in achieving that goal</li>
                <li>Acquire or create geospatial datasets of those attributes</li>
                <li>Rank the data in terms of desirability</li>
                <li>Assign weights to the datasets</li>
                <li>Run Weighted Overlay</li>
                <li>Analyze results</li>
                <li>Groundtruth results</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="research">Research</h2>
        <p>
            Since we've established our goal, we'll establish our scope. Because an orchard is defined as any plot of land where fruit or nut trees are grown, we’ll narrow the scope to an apple orchard. We won’t narrow the scope to any particular cultivars. We'll focus on doing relatively surface-level research given financial and time constraints. Next, we'll identify attributes required for a successful apple orchard.
        </p>

            I don’t know anything about growing apples! So I searched the internet. I limited myself to the first several pages of Google for the sake of convenience and speed. I found three resources that seemed somewhat reputable:

        <p>
            Unfortunately, the soil fertility recommendations do not agree and bear further research. The same goes for soil aeration, aspect (the direction a slope faces), and USDA Zone. Water-holding capacity seems intuitive enough to accept based on information available.
        </p>

            <a href="http://treefruit.wsu.edu/orchard-management/soils-nutrition/soil-health-in-orchards/">Soil Health in Orchards</a> claims agricultural soils average 1-6% organic matter but does not cite a source. Table 2 of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02571862.2014.944229">an academic study</a> records percentages ranges from 1-4ish%, but only from a single orchard. While many resources reiterate the importance of soil organic matter, few (reliable) sources provide quantitative recommendations, so for the sake of convenience we’ll go with 2-6% as the ideal amount of soil organic matter.

            T.T. Kozlowski’s <a href="http://joa.isa-arbor.com/request.asp?JournalID=1&ArticleID=2003&Type=2">Soil Aeration, Flooding, and Tree Growth</a> lists a multitude of reasons why soil aeration is a good thing but does not list quantitative measurements, nor is it strictly about apples, but I think it’s usable enough to inform our analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/sites/default/files/publications/af_site_assessment_perennial_crops.pdf">Site Assessment, Selection and Development for Perennial Crops Guide</a> recommends south-facing slopes due to greater exposure to sunlight, as does <a href="https://powderriver.msuextension.org/documents/treesshrubs/EB0222.pdf">Growing Fruit Trees in Montana</a>. <a href="https://www.nd.gov/ndda/sites/default/files/legacy/Marketing/OrchardManuaFinal.pdf">Starting a Community Orchard in North Dakota</a> recommends against south-facing slopes due to increased likelihood of breaking winter dormancy due to winter temperature fluctuations, which may also cause sunscalding and trunk cracking. Because tree damage would occur regardless of how quickly the tree grows, a north-facing slope will be considered ideal.

        <p>
            USDA zone preference likely depends on the cultivar chosen and this can be disregarded.

            <h3 id="proc_dems">Aerial imagery</h3>
            <p>
                A variety of aerial imagery was used as references, either for figure creation or creation of geospatial data. They include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>1938, August 18: United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) via the University of Wisconsin-Madison's <a href="https://maps.sco.wisc.edu/WHAIFinder/">WHAIFinder</a> service</li>

            <h3 id="buildingsroads">Buildings and roads</h3>
            <p>
                Buildings and roads were heads-up digitized using a combination of the slope raster and the leaf-off 2010 aerial imagery as references. The <a href="https://www.co.polk.wi.us/landinfogisdataportal">Polk County GIS Division</a> publishes road centerlines, but these are not typically helpful outside large-scale map symbology. To lessen the annoyance from storm damage, we'll restrict trees from being planted from within 30 feet of buildings and roads. 30ft is the approximate maximum apple tree height, but it’s probable the chosen cultivar will be much shorter than this to aid fruit access.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <a href="assets/images/orchard/figure/BuildingsRoads.jpg"><img src="assets/images/orchard/thumb/BuildingsRoads.jpg" alt="Displays building and road data created for this project against the 2020 aerial imagery."></a><br>
                <figcaption><small>Buildings (and 30ft from buildings) in red, roads in yellow. The combined area for both sets are a little under two acres, or 4% of the property.

            </figure>
            <h3 id="elevation">Elevation</h3>
            <p>
                Elevation data is commonly delivered in a raster format called a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). I located three DEM sets we could choose from: two acquired for the USGS's <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/3dep">3D Elevation Program</a> (3DEP, 2016) and one flown for Polk County (2015). While the 3DEP DEMs are more recent and thus would better match ground conditions, at <a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5df04f5be4b02caea0f4fd39">1 arc-second</a> (~30 meter) resolution and <a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5f7784da82ce1d74e7d6caec">1/3 arc-second</a> (~10 meter) they're far too coarse for our use case. Resolution refers to how much ground a given raster cell represents - in the case of the latter 3DEP set, one cell represents a 10 meter by 10 meter square on the ground. The Polk County 2015 will be used (1 meter resolution!), and from this we can derive slope and aspect. DEM tiles were downloaded from <a href="https://www.sco.wisc.edu/scoapps/lidar/tile-search/?layer=polk">here</a>. This set was acquired any time between March 21-31, 2015; unfortunately, the County's chosen contractor did not provide date metadata on a per-tile basis (or it's not public).

            <h3 id="floodplain">Floodplain</h3>
            <p>
                100-year floodplain polygons were downloaded from the Polk County GIS Division. This were visually validated against <a href="https://msc.fema.gov/nfhl">FEMA’s web map</a> and the official PDF map. The floodplain map is effective September 16, 2011.

            <h3 id="parcel">Property boundaries</h3>
            <p>
                Parcel data were acquired from the Polk County GIS Division and used to identify the boundary of the property. Validation of property boundaries would require a survey and is out of scope for this analysis. These data were downloaded August 29, 2021.
            </p>
            <h3 id="soil">Soil</h3>
            <p>
                Soil data were downloaded from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)’s <a href="https://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/app/WebSoilSurvey.aspx">Web Soil Survey</a>. This generated a product that included polygons of soil unit outlines and tabular data describing various soil attributes. The NRCS’ <a href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detailfull/soils/survey/geo/?cid=nrcs142p2_053620">Soil Data Viewer</a> plugin for ArcMap was used to generate polygons describing each soil unit’s available water capacity (previously referenced as water-holding capacity), depth to water table, drainage class, and organic matter content. I tried to only use “primary” soil attributes, or attributes intrinsic to the soil. For example, the Soil Data Viewer has a “Pesticide Leaching Potential” layer that would be very useful in this analysis, but I figured this Potential would be calculated using primary soil attributes, and therefore would effectively count those soil attributes twice. Additionally, only attributes with values for all soil polygons were used. This data was current as of September 9, 2021.

            <h3 id="proc_dems">Wetlands</h3>
            <p>
                Wetland polygons derived from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Wetland Survey were downloaded from the Polk County GIS Division and visually validated against <a href="https://dnrmaps.wi.gov/H5/?Viewer=SWDV&runWorkflow=Wetland">the DNR’s web map</a>. These data were augmented by heads-up digitization of an ephemeral stream channel and its floodplain. This feature is not at all apparent when viewing aerial imagery or the wetlands data, but I personally observed it when walking the property and my suspicions were confirmed when viewing the slope raster. It is especially evident in the 1947 aerial imagery.
            </p>

        <h2 id="processing">Processing</h2>

            After all primary data (DEMs, soil, etc.) were downloaded they were re-projected in NAD 1983 UTM Zone 15N. The DEMs used bilinear resampling during the re-projection process to reduce the presence of artifacts in the output rasters.

            Since the property fell on a seam line between two DEM tiles, they were merged together, then clipped using the property boundary polygon. From this elevation raster, the Slope and Aspect tools were used to generate slope and aspect rasters. The elevation, slope, and aspect tools were then Reclassified to 1) assign weights to the values in the raster and 2) convert the raster to an integer pixel type for use in the Weighted Overlay tool.

            Weights for elevation are straightforward – the literature suggests planting trees at elevation to avoid areas where cold air will pool. For similar reasons, the literature advises planting trees on a slope, but given the lack of information, I’ve defined “gentle” to incorporate the only quantitative numbers, plus a little more. One could just as easily interpret “gentle” to mean anything up to 45°. Aspect is also self-explanatory: the higher weights are assigned to north-facing slopes to reduce harm during winter. An aspect of -1°, or flat, was only calculated for the river.

            Buildings, floodplains, roads, and wetlands were treated identically. The polygons were clipped using the property boundary, converted to rasters with a 1m pixel resolution, and reclassified.

For example, if one has a 2-by-2 grid, and a 1-by-1 cell within that grid has a value of "3" while the rest of the 1-by-1 cells have no associated value, ArcMap would label those three cells as NODATA.

            Not only are the soils in floodplains and wetlands unsuited for growing apple trees, it would be financially unwise. For floodplains, there’s the obvious chance of the river flooding and your trees being washed away. For wetlands, there are financial penalties for destroying wetlands, or at the very least, legally destroying wetlands would likely be financially prohibitive. Anything not a floodplain or wetland is considered optimal.

            And this is the result of running Weighted Overlay! Land calculated as most optimal (5) comprises just under one acre, or around 2% of the property. The majority of this land is at the center of the property at approximately the current garden location and in the northwest quadrant, with smaller groupings on the far northeast side and sparsely bordering the access road. Next most-optimal land (4) comprises almost 11 acres (27%) and fills almost the entire northwest quadrant, a large portion of the center of the property, and even more land near the entrance to the access road. Middling-ranked land (3) consumes almost the same amount as 4-ranked land and is located almost entirely on the eastern half of the property, while filling the northwest quadrant where 4- and 5-ranked land does not. 2-ranked land (five acres, 12%) is almost exclusively present on the eastern half with a small crescent between the buildings and river. Finally, the least suitable land for an apple orchard (1) is adjacent the river in the southern half of the property, taking up a mere 0.05 acres (0.12%). Restricted land eliminates 12 acres (29%) from being considered.

        <h3 id="discresults">The results</h3>
        <p>
            The result of Weighted Overlay indicates a significant portion of the property would be well suited (4- or 5-ranked) for planting apple trees, which is great news! Should the family decide on an alternate location for the orchard, this allows them more flexibility. Additionally, the portions of the property that would be best suited are also the ones that would be relatively easy to access: the northwest quadrant could likely be accessed by crossing the road ditch, and the current planned location is near existing trails and the access road. Depending on the level of ambition present, the next step should be soil trenching and sampling to verify the result accurately represents ground conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was very surprised to discover that the location of the existing garden wound up being well-suited for apples. I'm sure the previous homeowner didn't expect to use that plot for apples, but I imagine that apples' preferred growing environment has many similarities with other plants. I imagine that homeowner did basically the same process as demonstrated here, albeit analogue and relying more on personal knowledge and hunches.
        </p>
        
        <h3 id="discdata">The data</h3>
        <p>
            A model is only as good as its data, and the data used in this analysis are generally high quality. These data are commonly used for planning by government agencies and private landowners alike. However, the elevation DEMs are deeply flawed. You will agree: in the aspect image below, each cardinal direction is given a different color. We can accept there was some flaw in LiDAR acquisition or its subsequent processing which causes these north-south trending lines, or we can accept the property is covered in rolls spaced around 70 feet apart
        </p>

        steps forward could include refining Weighted Overlay inputs with more data and groundtruthing, like 500 year floodplain
