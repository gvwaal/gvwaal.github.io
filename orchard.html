        <p>
            A derecho blasted through my friend's family cabin property on <a href="https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-weather/national-weather-service-confirms-2-derechos-ripped-through-minnesota-wisconsin">July 19, 2019</a>. Several months ago, a majority of the property was clear-cut in order to remove the downed trees. Naturally, there was (and continues to be) debate about what to do with the significant increase in unforested land, but one of the definite planned uses was an orchard. My friend was aware of my GIS/geology background and asked me to help plot figures in the design process.
        </p>
        <figure>
                <a href="assets/images/orchard/Aerial20202018.jpg"><img src="assets/images/orchard/Aerial20202018.jpg" alt="A side-by-side comparison of two leaf-on aerial imagery. Property boundary for reference with a teal outline."></a><br>
                <figcaption><small>A comparison of leaf-on aerial imagery from 2020 (left) and 2018 (right). Large swathes of downed trees cover much of northern half of the property.</small></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            During that process I was inspired to conduct a site suitability analysis to see if there were other areas of the property that might be optimally suited for an orchard. As currently designed, the orchard was to be situated adjacent a former garden, perhaps planted in the late 1990s-early 2000s.
        </p>
        <figure>
                <a href="assets/images/orchard/Aerial20051996.jpg"><img src="assets/images/orchard/Aerial20051996.jpg" alt="A side-by-side comparison of two leaf-on aerial imagery. Planned orchard shown for reference with a red outline."></a><br>
                <figcaption><small>A comparison of leaf-on aerial imagery from 2005 (left) and 1996 (right). Just east of the planned orchard in the 1996 imagery are two black dots I interpret to be trees, but it doesn't appear to definitively be a garden.</small></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            In summary, a site suitability analysis:
            <ol>
                <li>asks the user to provide sets of raster data,</li>
                <li>rank how important each category of data is, and</li>
                <li>how each set should be weighted</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            In this task, the first step is to identify one’s goal (an orchard), then consider what data is needed (environmental attributes needed for a successful orchard), establish how that data should be weighted, then acquire the data and convert it into a usable format. We’ll be using ArcMap 10.x in this analysis.
        </p>
        
        
                
        <h2 id="research">Research</h2>
        <p>
            Since the goal is established one must identify what’s needed for a successful orchard. However, since an orchard is defined as any plot of land where fruit or nut trees or grown, we’ll narrow the scope to an apple orchard. We won’t narrow the scope to any particular cultivars.
        </p>

            I don’t know anything about growing apples, so I searched the internet. I limited myself to the first several pages of Google for the sake of convenience and speed. I found three resources that seemed somewhat reputable:

        <p>
            Unfortunately, the soil fertility recommendations do not agree and bear further research. The same goes for soil aeration, aspect, and USDA Zone. Water-holding capacity seems intuitive enough to accept based on information available.
        </p>

            <a href="http://treefruit.wsu.edu/orchard-management/soils-nutrition/soil-health-in-orchards/">Soil Health in Orchards</a> claims agricultural soils average 1-6% organic matter but does not cite a source. Table 2 of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02571862.2014.944229">an academic study</a> records percentages ranges from 1-4ish%, but only from a single orchard. While many resources reiterate the importance of soil organic matter, few (reliable) sources provide quantitative recommendations, so for the sake of convenience we’ll go with 2-6% as the ideal amount of soil organic matter.

            T.T. Kozlowski’s <a href="http://joa.isa-arbor.com/request.asp?JournalID=1&ArticleID=2003&Type=2">Soil Aeration, Flooding, and Tree Growth</a> lists a multitude of reasons why soil aeration is a good thing but does not list quantitative measurements, nor is it strictly about apples, but I think it’s usable enough to inform our analysis.

            <a href="https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/sites/default/files/publications/af_site_assessment_perennial_crops.pdf">Site Assessment, Selection and Development for Perennial Crops Guide</a> recommends south-facing slopes due to greater exposure to sunlight, as does <a href="https://powderriver.msuextension.org/documents/treesshrubs/EB0222.pdf">Growing Fruit Trees in Montana</a>. <a href="https://www.nd.gov/ndda/sites/default/files/legacy/Marketing/OrchardManuaFinal.pdf">Starting a Community Orchard in North Dakota</a> recommends against south-facing slopes due to increased likelihood of breaking winter dormancy due to winter temperature fluctuations, which may also cause sunscalding and trunk cracking. Because tree damage would occur regardless of how quickly the tree grows, a north-facing slope will be considered ideal.

            USDA zone preference likely depends on the cultivar chosen and this can be disregarded.

            <p>
                A variety of aerial imagery was used as references, either for figure creation or creation of geospatial data. They include:

            <h3 id="buildingsroads">Buildings and roads</h3>
            <p>
                Roads and buildings were heads-up digitized using a combination of the slope raster and the leaf-off 2010 aerial imagery as references. The <a href="https://www.co.polk.wi.us/landinfogisdataportal">Polk County GIS Division</a> publishes road centerlines, but these are not typically helpful outside large-scale map symbology.

            <h3 id="elevation">Elevation</h3>
            <p>
                Elevation data is commonly delivered in a raster format called a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). In this particular area of the world there are at least two sets DEMs we could use, but fortunately one of those is a 1m flight that works best given the size of the property. From the elevation DEM we can derive slope and aspect. DEM tiles were downloaded from <a href="https://www.sco.wisc.edu/scoapps/lidar/tile-search/?layer=polk">here</a>. This DEM was acquired any time between March 21-31, 2015; unfortunately, the County's chosen contractor did not provide more specific date metadata.

            <p>
                100-year floodplain polygons were downloaded from the Polk County GIS Division. This were visually validated against <a href="https://msc.fema.gov/nfhl">FEMA’s web map</a> and the official PDF map. The floodplain map is effective September 16, 2011.

            <h3 id="parcel">Property boundaries</h3>
            <p>
                Parcel data were acquired from the Polk County GIS Division and used to identify the boundary of the property. Validation of property boundaries would require a survey and is out of scope for this analysis. These data were downloaded August 29, 2021.
            </p>
            <h3 id="soil">Soil</h3>
            <p>
                Soil data were downloaded from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)’s <a href="https://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/app/WebSoilSurvey.aspx">Web Soil Survey</a>. This generated a product that included polygons of soil unit outlines and tabular data describing various soil attributes. The NRCS’ <a href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detailfull/soils/survey/geo/?cid=nrcs142p2_053620">Soil Data Viewer</a> plugin for ArcMap was used to generate polygons describing each soil unit’s water-holding capacity, drainage class, organic matter content, and depth to water table. I tried to only use “primary” soil attributes, or attributes intrinsic to the soil. For example, the Soil Data Viewer has a “Pesticide Leaching Potential” layer that would be very useful in this analysis, but I figured this Potential would be calculated using primary soil attributes, and therefore would effectively count those soil attributes twice. Additionally, only attributes with values for all soil polygons were used. This data was current as of September 9, 2021.
            </p>
            <h3 id="proc_dems">Wetlands</h3>
            <p>
                Wetland polygons derived from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Wetland Survey were downloaded from the Polk County GIS Division and visually validated against <a href="https://dnrmaps.wi.gov/H5/?Viewer=SWDV&runWorkflow=Wetland">the DNR’s web map</a>. These data were augmented by heads-up digitization of an ephemeral stream channel and its floodplain. This feature is not at all apparent when viewing aerial imagery or the wetlands data, but I personally observed it when walking the property and my suspicions were confirmed when viewing the slope raster. It is especially evident in the 1947 aerial imagery.
            </p>
            <figure>

        <h2 id="processing">Processing</h2>
        <p>
            After all primary data (DEMs, soil, etc.) were downloaded they were re-projected in NAD 1983 UTM Zone 15N. The DEMs used bilinear resampling during the re-projection process to reduce the presence of artifacts in the output rasters.
        </p>

Darker color indicates steeper slopes.</small></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Since the property fell on a seam line between two DEM tiles, they were merged together, then clipped using the property boundary polygon. From this elevation raster, the Slope and Aspect tools were used to generate slope and aspect (slope exposure) rasters. The elevation, slope, and aspect tools were then Reclassified to 1) assign weights to the values in the raster and 2) convert the raster to an integer pixel type for use in the Weighted Overlay tool.

            Weights for elevation are straightforward – the literature suggests planting trees at elevation to avoid planting them in areas where cold air will pool. For similar reasons, the literature advises planting trees on a slope, but given the lack of information, I’ve defined “gentle” to incorporate the only quantitative numbers, plus a little more. One could just as easily interpret “gentle” to mean anything up to 45°. Aspect is also self-explanatory: the higher weights are assigned to north-facing slopes to reduce harm during winter. An aspect of -1°, or flat, was only calculated for the river.

            Floodplains and wetlands were treated identically. The downloaded polygons were clipped using the property boundary. In the output file, all features were merged together and assigned a value of 1. Using the property boundary, another polygon was created for each layer that filled the gap between the property boundary and the floodplain/wetland feature and assigned a value of 0. The polygons were converted to a raster with a 1m pixel resolution, and reclassified.

            Not only are the soils in floodplains and wetlands unsuited for growing apple trees, it would be financially unwise. For floodplains, there’s the obvious chance of the river flooding and your trees being washed away. For wetlands, there are financial penalties for destroying wetlands, or at the very least, legally destroying wetlands would likely be financially prohibitive. Anything not a floodplain or wetland is considered optimal.

            The downloaded soil polygon layer was clipped using the property boundary and the Soil Data Viewer was used to generate water-holding capacity, drainage class, organic matter content, and depth to water table layers, which were then converted to rasters and reclassified.

            The data that are the least easy to artificially alter have the highest weights, while those that can be artificially altered have lowest. Buildings, floodplains, roads, and wetlands are included exclusively to restrict land from being considered and have the lowest weights of all.
